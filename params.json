{"body":"DRAFT! sample code for IDDD Book \r\n================================\r\n\r\nThis is .NET Sample Project to accompany Event Sourcing materials \r\nfrom IDDD Book by [Vaughn Vernon](http://vaughnvernon.co/).\r\n\r\nPlease note, that at the moment of writing this sample project is **draft**. \r\nFinal revision will be delivered simultaneously with the book itself.\r\n\r\n### Contents\r\n\r\nThis project includes sample domain implemented with event sourcing pattern. \r\nMultiple persistence options are provided:\r\n\r\n* Microsoft SQL Server\r\n* MySQL\r\n* File storage\r\n* Windows Azure Blob Storage\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nStart by [downloading sources](https://github.com/Lokad/lokad-iddd-sample/zipball/master) (ZIP, Visual Studio) \r\nor by cloning a [git repository](https://github.com/Lokad/lokad-iddd-sample):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone git://github.com/Lokad/lokad-iddd-sample.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, open solution in Visual Studio (ModoDevelop might also work) and\r\nrun the project. The project is auto-configured to use file storage by default,\r\nand cleans it on every start.\r\n\r\nYou should see something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCommand: Create customer-12 named 'Lokad' with Eur\r\n  customer-12 r0 Event: Customer Lokad created with Eur\r\n  customer-12 r0 Event: Added 'Welcome bonus' 15 EUR | Tx 1 => 15 EUR\r\n  Completed in 145 ms\r\nCommand: Rename customer-12 to 'Lokad SAS'\r\n  customer-12 r1 Event: Customer renamed from 'Lokad' to 'Lokad SAS'\r\n  Completed in 27 ms\r\nCommand: Charge 20 EUR - 'Forecasting'\r\n  customer-12 r2 Event: Charged 'Forecasting' 20 EUR | Tx 2 => -5 EUR\r\n  Completed in 16 ms\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, you can dive into the code by starting with `Domain` folder in this solution.\r\n\r\nYou can also try plugging in other types of stores. Each store requires connection string \r\nand will auto-create all required resources automatically.\r\n\r\n### Want More?\r\n\r\nIf you want more details, here's what you can do next:\r\n\r\n* Check out the [Domain Driven Design community](http://dddcommunity.org/)\r\n* Dive into [Lokad.CQRS Sample Project](http://lokad.github.com/lokad-cqrs/) (much more detailed and practical version of this sample)\r\n* Check out [CQRS/DDD Pocket Guide](http://cqrsguide.com/case-studies) and [case studies](http://cqrsguide.com/case-studies)\r\n* Follow [@VaughnVernon](https://twitter.com/#!/VaughnVernon).\r\n* Follow [@abdullin](https://twitter.com/#!/abdullin).\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to ask contributors.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\n* [Vaughn Vernon](http://vaughnvernon.co/), Book author and reviewer\r\n* [Rinat Abdullin](http://abdullin.com), A+ES text and sample project.
